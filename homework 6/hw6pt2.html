    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2>Equal Count (Quantile) Classification</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 Projection preserves direction and shape of the map by distorting the area and distance. This is visualized by how the coordinate lines form 90 degree angles but as the circles near the North and South Poles, they are stretched and squished.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Interval Classification</h2>
    <h3>In the Aitoff Projection, shape, area, distance, and direction are all a little distortion. This distortion increases as you move away from the center of the map, but the benefit of distorting everything just a little, is that nothing is too different from reality. This map also curves at the sides, giving it a spherical effect that also helps emphasize that the Earth is not flat.</h3>

    <h2>Natural Breaks Classification</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator Projection is very commonly used in places like Google Maps because it is easy to visualize direction. The distance between the latitude lines increase as you move away from the equator, which is also seen as the size of the circles increase. This means that the area is distorted as you move towards the poles.</h3>
