    <h2>Equal Count (Quantile) Classification</h2>
    <h3>The Equal Count classification distributes an equal number of percentages in each class. Pros to this classification is that the count between the classes are very balanced. Cons is that, depending on outliers or extreme values in a dataset, one color can have a very large range while another color would have a very small range. It can easily be visually misinterpreted.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Interval Classification</h2>

    <h2>Natural Breaks Classification</h2>
    <h3>TTHe Natural Breaks Classification distributes the data to make sure there is less variation within each class. Pros of this classification is that there is less variation in each group. Cons is that this it doesn't suit low variance data as well. High variance makes the most of this classification.</h3>
