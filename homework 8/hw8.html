<h1>Homework 8: Highways and Populations in North Carolina</h1>

<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>This project uses vector geoprocessing analysis to answer the following real-world question: Is there a correlation between the location of major highways and population sizes in North Carolina?</p>

<!-- Pre-work Discussion -->
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In order to create this map I got shapefiles of major highways in the USA and North Carolina counties, both in 2264 projection. I also got a CSV file of population data by county for North Carolina, which I cleaned to only have the county name, population, and GEOID. In QGIS, I uploaded the data and joined the counties shapefile and CSV file, and then used that to create a chloropleth map of NC population by county. Then, I intersected the NC shapefile and major highways shapefile so that only the highways within NC borders would be saved. I then created a buffer of 12ft, the width around major highways, to mimic the actual space of the highways as well. This is better seen in the second image.</p><br>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This map clearly demonstrates the existence of major highways through counties of higher populations, answering the original question.</p><br>
