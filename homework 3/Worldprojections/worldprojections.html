    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">How I displayed this map in different projections in QGIS</h2>
    <p>In QGIS, I displayed the same map in different projections by changing the EPSG value. Every projection has a unique EPSG value correlates with certain measurements and coordinates that distorts different aspects of a projection, whether that be shape, area, distance, direction, or any combination of them.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 Projection preserves direction and shape of the map by distorting the area and distance. This is visualized by how the coordinate lines form 90 degree angles but as the circles near the North and South Poles, they are stretched and squished.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>In the Aitoff Projection, shape, area, distance, and direction are all a little distortion. This distortion increases as you move away from the center of the map, but the benefit of distorting everything just a little, is that nothing is too different from reality. This map also curves at the sides, giving it a spherical effect that also helps emphasize that the Earth is not flat.</h3>

    <h2>WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator Projection is very commonly used in places like Google Maps because it is easy to visualize direction. The distance between the latitude lines increase as you move away from the equator, which is also seen as the size of the circles increase. This means that the area is distorted as you move towards the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>In the Winkel Projection, the equator and central meridian are both straight. All other longitude and latitude lines are distorted, meaning shape, area, direction and distance are all a little distorted the farther you get from the center.</h3>

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>In a cylindrical equal area projection, the lines are all parallel. All forms of distortion increases as you move farther away from the center of the map, the worst being at the poles, which are completely stretched out to the size of the equator. The accuracy is highest at the center of the map.</h3>

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a conic projection from the Northern Hemisphere where all the longitude lines are parallel and meet in the middle while the latitude lines are curved around. It doesn't close all the way around. This map also contains a lot of distortion in all aspects of size, area, direction and distance.</h3>

    <h2>Azimuthal Equidistant (North Pole) Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Azimuthal Equidistant Projection is similar to the Equidistant Conic Projection above in that they both are conic projections from the perspective of the Northern Hemisphere. The Azimuthal Projection differs in that the South Pole closes all the way around, making the map a circle. THe longitude lines area all parallel and the latitude lines are all curved, creating distortion in area, size, direction and distance.</h3>

    <h2>Van der Grinten (I) Sphere Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Van der Grinten Projection is very similar to the Pseudo-Mercator projection in that the circles are smaller near the equator and get larger, and therefore more distorted, as you move away from the equator. It is different, however, in how the latitude and longitude lines curve the farther it gets from the equator as well. This gives the map a rounder shape, demonstrating how the Earth is not flat.</h3>

    <h2>World Times Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Times Projection has distortion in all aspects. The circles get larger and less circular as you move away from the equator. The equator and the Prime Meridian are both straight lines, with the other coordinate lines becoming more curved as you move from the equator. This means the least distortion in this map is at the center, and the most distortion is near the poles.</h3>
